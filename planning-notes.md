# 🧾 Project 1: Executive Budgeting + Forecasting  

---

## 📌 1. Problem Statement

Many organizations struggle to align departmental budgets, forecasts, and actuals in a unified, data-driven way. Manual processes and fragmented tools lead to slow reporting cycles, limited visibility into financial performance, and reactive decision-making.

This project simulates a professional-grade budgeting and forecasting system designed for executive use. It combines financial modeling, variance analysis, and scenario testing to provide CFOs and FP&A teams with accurate, actionable insights across time periods and departments. The solution aims to enable better planning, proactive cost management, and improved forecast accuracy.

This tool helps executives answer: "How are we performing against our plan, and what happens if conditions change?"

## 🎯 3. Project Goals & Success Metrics

### Goals
- Develop an executive-level forecasting and budgeting tool that provides clear visibility into financial performance across departments and time periods.
- Simulate real-world budget vs. actual variance tracking to identify deviations and support proactive management.
- Enable dynamic scenario testing to help executives assess the financial impact of strategic decisions and changing assumptions.
- Deliver performance summaries and visual dashboards that facilitate quick, data-driven decision-making.
- Provide an intuitive user experience tailored to the needs of executives, analysts, and department heads.
- Design the solution to be scalable, accommodating increasing data volume and organizational complexity over time.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Burn Rate**: Monitor the rate at which cash is being spent monthly to manage financial health.
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Measure the percentage difference between forecasted and actual financial results to improve planning reliability.
- **Monthly Variance**: Track the dollar and percentage difference between budgeted and actual expenses/revenues each month.
- **Runway Estimation**: Calculate how many months the organization can operate before cash reserves are depleted based on current burn rate.
- **Budget Utilization Rate**: Percentage of budget spent to identify underspending or overspending trends.

## 📈 4. Use Cases & User Scenarios

### Use Cases

- **Executive Financial Review:**  
  The CFO reviews quarterly financial performance, comparing budget, actuals, and forecasts to identify key variances and assess organizational health.

- **Departmental Budget Management:**  
  Department heads submit monthly budget updates and review variance reports to ensure spending aligns with approved budgets.

- **Forecast Adjustment & Scenario Testing:**  
  FP&A analysts run “what-if” scenarios such as cost reduction initiatives or revenue growth changes to predict impacts on cash flow and profitability.

- **Board Presentation Preparation:**  
  Finance teams generate clear, concise dashboards and reports for board meetings, highlighting financial risks and opportunities.

---

### User Scenarios

#### Scenario A: CFO Marie L.  
Marie logs into the dashboard before the quarterly executive meeting to review actual vs. budget variances across departments. She drills down into the marketing budget where she notices overspending and uses scenario tools to evaluate potential corrective actions.

#### Scenario B: FP&A Analyst Jason R.  
Jason updates the forecast with new sales data from the field. He tests multiple scenarios including a delay in product launch and quickly generates reports to communicate the financial impact to leadership.

#### Scenario C: Operations Director Linda M.  
Linda reviews her department’s monthly variance report, identifies unexpected costs, and submits an updated forecast with explanations through the system, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## 🗃️ 5. Data Requirements

- Monthly/quarterly financial data:
  - Budget, Actuals, Forecasts
- Revenue and cost streams
- Departments / business units
- Time period coverage (e.g., 24 months)

**Planned Format:**  
- Synthetic data (initially) to facilitate controlled testing and scenario modeling.

**Real Data Considerations:**  
Where possible, I aim to integrate real financial data from publicly available sources such as SEC filings, open government budgets, or financial datasets from SimFin and Kaggle. This will enhance the project’s authenticity and provide exposure to real-world data challenges.

---

## 🧪 6. Synthetic Data Plan

To create a realistic dataset for development and testing, I simulate monthly budget, forecast, and actual spending data over a 24-month period.

**Key design choices:**

- **Departments:** HR, IT, Operations, Marketing, Sales, Finance  
- **Expense Categories:** Salaries, Travel, Software, Rent, Training, Supplies  
- **Time Range:** Monthly data for 24 months starting January 2023  
- **Seasonality:** For example, Marketing expenses spike in Q4 (holiday campaigns)  
- **Trends:** Gradual monthly increases in some categories to reflect growth  
- **Variance & Noise:** Random noise added to forecasts and actuals to simulate real-world variability, including occasional outliers

The resulting dataset will have columns for `Date`.  `Department`, `Category`, `Budget`, `Forecast`, and `Actual`. This structure supports variance analysis, forecasting validation, and scenario modeling.
